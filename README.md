# LMA Proxy charm

This Juju machine charm that provides a single integration point in the machine world with the Kubernetes-based [LMA bundle](https://charmhub.io/lma-light).

This charm is designed to be easy to integrate in bundles and Juju-driven appliances, and reduce the amount of setup needed to integrate with the Kubernetes-based LMA to just connect the LMA Proxy charm with it.
